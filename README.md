# smw-timer
a timer and death counter for smw and smw hacks

Not the most user friendly thing in the world, but file an issue if you're intersted in using this and I'll work with you to make it user friendly. Right now you can use the functions exported onto the window to control what's going on. addSplit('split name'), startTimer(), pauseTimer(), nextSplit() are the relevant functions.
